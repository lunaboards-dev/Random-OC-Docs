# Open Simple Disk Info, Version 1.1
Much of this information is shared with OSDI v1.0

## Notes
* Numbers are little endian, always.
* OSDI tables are 512 bytes or a single physical sector, whichever is larger, and stored at the very start of the disk
* The first entry in the table MUST have a size of 0 and a type of `OSDI\xAA\xAA\x55\x55`, with the start set to the version the table is compliant to (currently `1`).
* Entries with an empty (all NULLs) type are considered unallocated.

## Structure
```c
struct OSDI_Entry {
  uint32_t start_sector;
  uint32_t size;
  char type[8]; // can also be treated as uint64_t
  uint8_t flags[3]; // uint24_t
  char name[13];
};
```

## Flags/Masks
| Hex | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x000008 | Read-only |
| 0x000010 | Hidden |
| 0x000020 | System partition |
| 0x000200 | Active |

## Partition Table Visualization
| Start (u32) | Size (u32) | Type (8 bytes) | Flags (u24) | Name (12 bytes + Null terminator) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | `OSDI\xAA\xAA\x55\x55` | `0x0` | `            ` |
| 2 | 8 | `BOOTCODE` | `0x200` | `            ` |
| 10 | 128 | `ZEALFS  ` | `0x0` | `BOOT        ` |
| 139 | 8054 | `foxfs   ` | `0x0` | `Tsuki       ` |

## More about flags
### 0x000200 - Active
If the partition is of type `BOOTCODE`, the entire partition should be loaded and executed. Any other partition type should have the first 1024 bytes or physical sector, whichever is larger, loaded and executed.
